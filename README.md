# Welcome to your GitHub repository!

If you can read this, you should now have access to this repository and be able to submit future assignments here. Further instructions on how to submit here via GitHub's web UI and good version control practices will be discussed in class.

### Notes on git (Advanced Users)

Use of git on the command line is not required for this course, but if you wish to use git on the CLI, please review documentation or a tutorial on git. ([GitHub provides an interactive tutorial here.](https://try.github.io/)) However, be aware that you will not be creating a new repository, instead [cloning this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), [adding files and committing changes to your local repository](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line/), and then [pushing them to the remote repository on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/). Additionally, as this class focuses on solo coding, additional branches and forks will not be necessary; only commits on the GitHub origin master branch will be considered for grading.
